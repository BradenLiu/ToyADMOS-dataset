# ToyADMOS dataset
ToyADMOS dataset is a machine operating sounds dataset of approximately 540 hours of normal machine operating sounds and over 12,000 samples of anomalous sounds collected with four microphones at a 48kHz sampling rate, prepared by Yuma Koizumi and members in NTT Media Intelligence Laboratories. The ToyADMOS dataset is designed for anomaly detection in machine operating sounds (ADMOS) research. We have collected normal and anomalous operating sounds of miniature machines by deliberately damaging their components. It is designed for three tasks of ADMOS: product inspection (toy car), fault diagnosis for fixed machine (toy conveyor), and fault diagnosis for moving machine (toy train). For more information, refer to the paper [1]. If you use the ToyADMOS dataset in your work, please cite this paper where it was introduced.
